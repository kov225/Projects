I am a **Data Science graduate student at Lehigh University (GPA: 3.94)** with a strong interest in **applied statistics, interpretable machine learning, and ML systems engineering**.

This repository is my **academic and technical portfolio**, intentionally structured to distinguish between:
- research projects  
- major coursework projects  
- assignments  
- skill-building practice  
- ongoing learning  

Each folder contains its own README that clearly explains scope, intent, and outcomes.

## Featured Work (Start Here)

If you are a recruiter or reviewer, these best represent my work:

- **Optimized Inference Pipeline for Mistral LLMs**  
  High-performance inference and benchmarking on a single NVIDIA T4 GPU  
  Focus on quantization, batching, warmup, LoRA support, and throughput of 200+ tokens/sec  
  Folder: `mistral-llm-optimised-inference`

- **Research Project: Apple Market Analysis**  
  Interpretable, rule-based analysis of AAPL price and volume data with iterative research notebooks  
  Folder: `research-project`

- **Global Trade Inequality (Statistics)**  
  Large-scale statistical analysis using a very large global trade dataset  
  Folder: `stats`

## How to Read This Repository

Not everything here is a project, and that is intentional.

This repository reflects how real technical work actually happens:
- exploration to refinement to documentation  
- research alongside coursework  
- polished projects alongside practice work  

Each section is clearly labeled so reviewers can quickly distinguish research, coursework, and assignments.

## Repository Overview

### ML Systems and LLM Engineering
**Folder:** `mistral-llm-optimised-inference`

An optimized inference pipeline for Mistral-based large language models, designed for resource-constrained environments.

Key aspects:
- Single GPU deployment on NVIDIA T4
- 4-bit and 8-bit quantization via bitsandbytes
- Batch concurrency for throughput scaling
- CUDA warmup for stable benchmarking
- Optional LoRA adapter loading
- End-to-end tokens per second benchmarking

This project emphasizes deployment efficiency, hardware-aware optimization, and engineering trade-offs.

---

### Research Project
**Folder:** `research-project`

An independent research project analyzing Apple (AAPL) market data, covering:
- raw data ingestion, cleaning, and feature engineering  
- structural market analysis such as support and resistance  
- rule-based scoring frameworks  
- iterative experimentation preserved across notebooks  

Focus is on interpretability, reasoning, and research workflow rather than black-box prediction.

---

### Statistics Coursework
**Folder:** `stats`

- **Global Trade Inequality (Major Project)**  
  A multi-milestone statistics project using a very large international trade dataset  
  The data spans many countries, product categories, and years, and focuses on inequality and distributional analysis.

- **Software Pricing (Assignment)**  
  A smaller, standalone statistics assignment demonstrating foundational analysis and interpretation.

---

### AI Coursework
**Folder:** `AI-Coursework`

Coursework from CSF 407 (Artificial Intelligence), applying Genetic Algorithms to:
- optimize shell-and-tube heat exchanger design  
- minimize total discounted lifecycle cost  

Includes Python implementation, academic presentation, and literature grounding.

---

### R Coursework
**Folder:** `R-Coursework`

Weekly R assignments focused on:
- statistical computing  
- data wrangling  
- visualization  
- exploratory data analysis  

Top-performing student in the class.  
(Some datasets were lost after course completion, but all analytical logic is preserved.)

---

### Coding Weekly
**Folder:** `Coding Weekly`

Weekly Python problem-solving exercises emphasizing:
- core programming fundamentals  
- logical reasoning  
- clean and correct implementations  

This folder demonstrates consistency and strong foundations rather than polish.

---

### Ethics Coursework
**Folder:** `ethics`

Assignments focused on responsible data science and ethical reasoning.

- **Project 1 (with its own README)**  
  Integrates data analysis, academic literature review, and ethical evaluation.
- Additional assignments included in notebook and HTML formats.

---

### Capstone Work
**Folders:**  
- `capstone`  
- `capstone-alternative-approach`

Two capstone tracks are maintained:
- Primary capstone with full end-to-end implementation  
- Alternative approach that is research-driven and exploratory  

The alternative approach intentionally omits components because it reflects ongoing research rather than incompleteness.

---

### Certificates
**Folder:** `certificates`

Certificates from completed courses in:
- data science  
- statistics  
- machine learning  
- applied analytics  

This section is actively growing as I continue structured learning.

---

## Technical Stack

- **Languages:** Python, R  
- **Data and Statistics:** Pandas, NumPy, statistical methods  
- **ML and AI:** scikit-learn, Genetic Algorithms, LLM inference optimization  
- **Systems:** quantization, batching, benchmarking, GPU-aware deployment  
- **Workflow:** Jupyter notebooks, exploratory to structured pipelines  

---

## Guiding Principles

- Depth over flash  
- Reasoning over blind optimization  
- Transparency over over-polish  

This is a living repository and will continue evolving with new research, coursework, and systems experiments.
