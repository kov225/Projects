# Koushik Vennalakanti — Data Science & AI Portfolio

Hi, I’m Koushik, a Data Science graduate student at Lehigh University (CGPA 4.0).  
This repository serves as my **central academic and project portfolio**, containing a mix of **research work, applied projects, coursework, and certifications**.

The repository is intentionally structured to distinguish between:
- Portfolio-grade projects
- Academic coursework
- Research and capstone work
- Skill-building exercises

Each major folder contains its own README explaining context and outcomes.
