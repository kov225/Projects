### Data Science • AI • Statistics • Research

I am a **Data Science graduate student at Lehigh University (GPA: 3.94)** with a strong focus on **applied statistics, interpretable machine learning, optimization, and research-driven analysis**.

This repository is my **academic and technical portfolio**.  
It is intentionally structured to distinguish between:
- research projects  
- major coursework projects  
- assignments  
- skill-building practice  
- ongoing learning  

Each folder includes a README explaining **scope, intent, and outcomes**.

## 🔎 How to Read This Repository

Not everything here is a “project” — and that is by design.

This repo reflects **how real technical work progresses**:
- exploration → refinement → documentation
- projects alongside assignments
- clean separation of scope and intent

If you are reviewing this repo, start with:
- **Research Project**
- **Statistics → Global Trade Inequality**
- **Capstone**

## 📁 Repository Overview

### 🧠 Research Project
**Folder:** `research-project`

An independent research project on **Apple (AAPL) market data**, covering:
- raw data ingestion → cleaning → feature engineering  
- structural analysis (support/resistance)  
- rule-based scoring frameworks  
- iterative experimentation preserved via notebooks  

Emphasis is on **reasoning, interpretability, and structure**, not black-box prediction.

---

### 📊 Statistics Coursework
**Folder:** `stats`

- **Global Trade Inequality (Major Project)**  
  A multi-milestone statistics project using a **very large global trade dataset**  
  (countries × products × time).  
  Focus on inequality, distributional analysis, and large-scale aggregation.

- **Software Pricing (Assignment)**  
  A smaller, standalone statistics assignment demonstrating foundational analysis.

---

### 🤖 AI Coursework
**Folder:** `AI Coursework`

Coursework from **CSF 407 – Artificial Intelligence**, applying **Genetic Algorithms** to:
- optimize shell-and-tube heat exchanger design  
- minimize total discounted lifecycle cost  

Includes Python implementation, presentation, and literature grounding.

---

### 📐 R Coursework
**Folder:** `R Coursework`

Weekly R assignments focused on:
- statistical computing  
- data wrangling  
- visualization  
- exploratory analysis  

🏆 **Top-performing student in the class**.  
(Some datasets are missing due to data loss; all analytical logic is preserved.)

---

### 💻 Coding Weekly
**Folder:** `Coding Weekly`

Weekly Python problem-solving exercises emphasizing:
- core programming fundamentals  
- logical reasoning  
- clean, correct implementations  

This folder demonstrates **consistency and foundations**, not polish.

---

### 🧭 Ethics Coursework
**Folder:** `ethics`

Assignments focused on **responsible data science and ethical reasoning**.

- **Project 1** (with its own README):  
  Combines data analysis, academic literature review, and ethical evaluation.
- Additional assignments included in notebook and HTML form.

---

### 🎓 Capstone Work
**Folders:**  
- `capstone`  
- `capstone 2nd approach`

Two capstone tracks are maintained:
- **`capstone`** → primary capstone project  
- **`capstone 2nd approach`** → alternative, research-driven approach  

The second approach intentionally omits components as it reflects **ongoing exploratory research**, not incompleteness.

---

### 📜 Certificates
**Folder:** `certificates`

Certificates from completed courses in:
- data science  
- statistics  
- machine learning  
- applied analytics  

This section is **actively growing** as learning continues.

---

## 🛠 Technical Stack(Only the ones used in these projects displayed)

- **Languages:** Python, R  
- **Analysis:** Pandas, NumPy, statistical methods  
- **ML / AI:** scikit-learn, Genetic Algorithms, optimization  
- **Workflow:** Jupyter, exploratory → structured pipelines  
- **Philosophy:** interpretable models, scale-aware analysis, honest documentation  

---

## 🎯 Guiding Principles

- Depth over flash  
- Reasoning over blind optimization  
- Transparency over over-polish  

This is a **living repository** and will continue evolving with new research, coursework, and experiments.
