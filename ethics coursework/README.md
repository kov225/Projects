# Ethics Coursework — Responsible Data Science & Analysis

This folder contains coursework completed as part of an **ethics-focused class**, emphasizing responsible data science practices, ethical reasoning, and critical evaluation of data-driven systems.

The work here is **assignment-based**, not a research project, and is included to demonstrate structured thinking, clear communication, and ethical awareness in technical contexts.

## 📌 Project 1: Ethics Assignment — Data Analysis & Interpretation

This is the **primary ethics assignment** in this folder.  
It has its **own dedicated README** inside the project directory that explains the problem context, methodology, and conclusions in detail.

This README provides a high-level overview of how the ethics-related work in this folder is organized.
