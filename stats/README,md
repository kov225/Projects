# Statistics Coursework — Applied Statistical Analysis

This folder contains my **statistics coursework**, focused on applying statistical reasoning, data analysis, and interpretation to real-world datasets.

The contents include:
- **One large, multi-part statistics project** developed across multiple milestones
- **One smaller, standalone statistics assignment**

The emphasis throughout is on **statistical rigor, scale-aware analysis, and clear interpretation**, rather than black-box modeling.

## 📌 Project: Global Trade Inequality (Multi-Part Statistics Project)

This is a **single, large-scale statistics project** developed over multiple milestones, which is why it appears as three related files.

### 📂 Files
- `Cheema_Vennalakanti_Global Trade Inequality.ipynb`
- `Cheema_Vennalakanti_Global Trade Inequality (1).pdf`
- `_StatMilestone2.pdf`

### 🌍 Data Scale & Context
This project works with a **very large global trade dataset**, covering:
- Multiple countries and regions
- Numerous product categories
- Trade flows across time

Handling this dataset required careful preprocessing, aggregation, and summarization to make meaningful statistical analysis feasible.

---

### 🧠 Project Focus
The project analyzes **global trade inequality** using international trade data, with an emphasis on:

- Exploratory analysis of large-scale economic data
- Distributional and inequality patterns across countries and regions
- Group-wise and comparative statistical analysis
- Translating complex trade data into interpretable insights

The Jupyter notebook contains the **full analytical workflow**, while the PDF files correspond to **formal milestone submissions and written reports**.

---

### 🔍 Key Statistical Concepts Applied
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on large datasets
- Distributional analysis and comparison
- Aggregation and summarization across groups
- Interpretation of inequality measures
- Clear linkage between statistical evidence and conclusions

This project demonstrates the ability to **work with large, complex datasets** while maintaining statistical clarity.

## 📌 Assignment: Software Pricing Analysis

This is a **standalone statistics assignment**, included here for completeness.

### 📂 File
- `Vennalakanti_Koushik_softwarePricing.ipynb`

### 🧠 Assignment Focus
The assignment involves:
- Data cleaning and exploratory analysis
- Summary statistics
- Basic comparative analysis
- Interpretation of observed pricing patterns

This work is intentionally smaller in scope and serves as an example of **foundational statistical analysis** rather than a full research project.

## 🛠 Tools & Techniques Used

Across the coursework in this folder:
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Statistical summaries and visualization
- Hypothesis-driven exploratory analysis

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Folder

This folder exists to demonstrate:
- Strong foundations in **applied statistics**
- Experience working with **large-scale datasets**
- Ability to manage **multi-stage analytical work**
- Clear communication of statistical results in both notebooks and reports

---

## ✅ Key Takeaway

This folder highlights **statistical thinking at scale**, alongside solid foundational assignments that support broader analytical competence.
