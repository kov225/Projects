# Coding Weekly — Python Practice & Problem Solving

This folder contains my **weekly coding assignments and practice problems**, primarily implemented in **Python**.  
The goal of this work is to build **strong problem-solving foundations**, fluency in Python syntax, and confidence in translating logical requirements into correct, readable code.

This is a **skill-development folder**, not a single standalone project.

---

## 📌 Purpose of This Folder

The files in this folder represent:
- Consistent weekly coding practice
- Exposure to a wide variety of problem types
- Incremental improvement in logic, structure, and clarity
- Reinforcement of core programming concepts used in data science and AI

Rather than showcasing one “perfect” solution, this folder demonstrates **process, repetition, and growth**.

---

## 📂 Contents

The folder consists of multiple Python scripts, typically named:

- `student_code.py`
- `student_code (1).py`
- `student_code (2).py`
- …
- `student_code (12).py`
- `800189300.py`

Each file corresponds to an individual weekly assignment or coding exercise.

---

## 🧠 Types of Problems Covered

Across these files, the exercises commonly involve:

- Conditional logic and control flow
- Loops and iterative computation
- Functions and modular code
- Basic data structures (lists, dictionaries, strings)
- Input validation and edge cases
- Algorithmic thinking and step-by-step reasoning
- Translating problem statements into executable logic

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python
- Standard Python libraries
- Script-based execution (no external frameworks)

---

## 🎯 Why This Folder Matters

This folder exists to show:
- Comfort with **writing Python from scratch**
- Ability to reason through problems independently
- Consistency over time (weekly cadence)
- Strong fundamentals that support higher-level work in:
  - Data science
  - Machine learning
  - Research and experimentation

It complements larger projects by demonstrating **core competence**, not just final outcomes.

---

## ⚠️ Notes

- File naming reflects submission-based coursework and weekly iterations
- Some problems are intentionally simple; others are more logic-heavy
- The emphasis is on correctness, clarity, and learning—not optimization

---

## ✅ Key Takeaway

This folder demonstrates **discipline, consistency, and strong programming fundamentals**, forming the backbone for more advanced work elsewhere in the repository.
