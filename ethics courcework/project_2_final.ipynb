    "# Context and Fairness Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "**Context.** The Civilian Complaint Review Board (CCRB) evaluates civilian allegations against NYPD officers and decides whether each allegation is valid or invalid, and this dataset contains many years of those allegation-level decisions along with officer and complainant attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fairness definition.** In this project I define fairness as a clear, argued commitment to what we protect, how we measure it, and where we intervene in the workflow. I treat **race** and **gender** as protected because they are legally and socially salient in policing outcomes, and unequal error burdens across these attributes risk compounding historic disadvantage and eroding public trust. My primary concern is two kinds of harm: missed true harms to complainants and unjust false positives for officers. After considering metrics discussed in Mulligan et al. such as **Demographic Parity**, **Equalized Odds**, **Predictive Value Parity**, and **calibration by group**, I adopt an **Equal Opportunity style criterion** within the Equalized Odds family that prioritizes **parity in true positive rates** across protected groups, since the CCRB’s accountability mission is to recognise genuine misconduct equally across groups. I explicitly prefer this over demographic parity, which can be misleading when base rates differ and can force equalisation that ignores case facts, and over predictive parity, which can tolerate unequal sensitivity and leave some groups with systematically lower chances of having true harms recognised. I accept that this choice may yield different positive prediction rates across groups; my goal is to avoid unequal under-detection of genuine misconduct while I monitor **false positive rate** gaps and **calibration** by group as guardrails to protect officers from unfair sanctioning. I evaluate gender alongside race because alleged harms and disciplinary outcomes can vary by gender in policy-relevant ways, and excluding gender could mask unequal burdens. Given New York City’s history of strained police community relations and racial disparities in enforcement, fairness here is not only statistical but also about public trust for complainants, officers, CCRB staff, NYPD leadership, advocacy groups, and the public. In line with Mulligan’s call for shared vocabularies and explicit scope, I will publish decision criteria and thresholds, audit **TPR** and **FPR** by group on a schedule, show calibration by group, and state trade offs up front so stakeholders understand both the measurement and the actions that follow.\n"

    "## Applying My Fairness Definition to the CCRB Data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "I define fairness as treating officers equitably across **race** and **gender** while ensuring that genuine misconduct is recognized consistently.  \n",
    "This follows an **Equal Opportunity** principle: the CCRB process should maintain comparable sensitivity (true-positive rate) across protected groups.  \n",
    "I also monitor **false-positive risk** and **calibration**, since fairness should not over-penalize any group.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Label Mapping and Decided Set\n",
    "To build a factual “ground truth,” I grouped complaint dispositions into:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Valid (positive)** – outcomes starting with *“Substantiated…”*  \n",
    "* **Invalid (negative)** – *“Unsubstantiated,” “Unfounded,” “Exonerated,” “Within Guidelines,”* or *“Unable to Determine”*  \n",
    "* **Excluded** – administrative exits such as withdrawn, uncooperative, mediated, or officer-unidentified cases  \n",
    "\n",
    "Restricting to Valid and Invalid created a **decided set** of about **213k allegations**, with an overall substantiation rate near **29%**.  \n",
    "Removing *“Unable to Determine”* raised the rate slightly to **≈30%**, but did not change conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Coverage and Missingness\n",
    "Most decided rows link successfully to officer demographics.  \n",
    "A small **“Unknown”** category for race or gender remains visible for transparency but is **excluded from fairness tests**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Raw Fairness Signal\n",
    "Substantiation rates (with Wilson 95% confidence intervals) show the following patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### By Officer Race\n",
    "| Officer Race | Substantiation Rate | Notes |\n",
    "|---------------|--------------------|--------|\n",
    "| White | ≈ 29.5% | Reference group (largest N) |\n",
    "| Hispanic | ≈ 35.0% | Higher than White (+5.5 pp) |\n",
    "| Black | ≈ 30.4% | Close to White |\n",
    "| Asian | ≈ 38.4% | Higher than White (+8.9 pp) |\n",
    "| American Indian | ≈ 24.1% | **Tiny sample — wide CI** |\n",
    "| Unknown | — | Shown for completeness; excluded from tests |\n",
    "\n",
    "#### By Officer Gender\n",
    "| Officer Gender | Substantiation Rate | Notes |\n",
    "|-----------------|--------------------|--------|\n",
    "| Male | ≈ 31.6% | Reference group |\n",
    "| Female | ≈ 31.5% | Essentially equal |\n",
    "| TGNC / Other | ≈ 35.1% | **Very small N — wide CI** |\n",
    "| Unknown | — | Shown for completeness; excluded from tests |\n",
    "\n",
    "Relative to White and Male references, Hispanic and Asian officers show higher substantiation in raw data, but gender differences are negligible.  \n",
    "Raw disparities hint at case-mix effects rather than bias, so I controlled for context next.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adjusted Analysis\n",
    "A logistic regression for *substantiated vs not* included:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Officer race and gender  \n",
    "* Borough of incident  \n",
    "* Location type  \n",
    "* FADO category (Force, Abuse of Authority, Discourtesy, Offensive Language)  \n",
    "* Year  \n",
    "\n",
    "After adjustment, race effects were statistically insignificant and close to parity with White.  \n",
    "Male officers showed slightly higher odds of substantiation.  \n",
    "Context and time explained most variation, suggesting that raw race gaps largely reflect **where, when, and what kind of cases** occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stratified and Sensitivity Checks\n",
    "* Within each **FADO** category, Asian and Hispanic officers generally had higher raw substantiation than White officers, but effects varied by type and period.  \n",
    "* Over time, substantiation rates rose from roughly 15–20% in the early 2000s to ≈55% after 2020, confirming strong period effects.  \n",
    "* Excluding *“Unable to Determine”* changed base rates slightly but not conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Penalties After Substantiation\n",
    "To test fairness in consequences, I merged **substantiated cases** with the **penalties** table on *Complaint Id + Tax ID*.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Any-penalty probability**\n",
    "* **Race:** White ~66%, Hispanic ~67%, Black ~68%, Asian ~65%, American Indian ~82% (**tiny N**)  \n",
    "* **Gender:** Male ~67%, Female ~64%, TGNC/Other ~73% (**tiny N**)\n",
    "\n",
    "Penalty severity, where recorded, showed minimal group difference.  \n",
    "Overall, about **two-thirds** of substantiated cases led to a penalty, with no strong race- or gender-based divergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation and Limitations\n",
    "* Apparent raw race differences shrink after adjusting for context.  \n",
    "* Gender patterns remain mostly even.  \n",
    "* The penalty follow-through stage appears similarly consistent.  \n",
    "* Remaining limitations include small subgroup sizes, unobserved case quality, and CCRB process selection effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bottom Line\n",
    "Under an Equal Opportunity lens, I find **no robust residual race effect** once context is controlled, and **gender parity** overall.  \n",
    "Penalties following substantiation also appear broadly consistent across groups.  \n",
    "Fairness monitoring should remain continuous ,publishing group-wise substantiation rates, calibration checks, and penalty audits,to ensure *equal facts = equal outcomes* over time.\n"

    "##  Fairness of the Predictive Model\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose\n",
    "To assess whether a predictive model might replicate or amplify disparities, I trained a **logistic-regression classifier** to predict substantiation using contextual features (FADO type, borough, location type, incident hour, evidence flags, officer demographics, and year).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fairness Objective\n",
    "The model is evaluated under the same **Equal Opportunity** criterion: similar **true-positive rates (TPR)** across protected groups, with **false-positive rate (FPR)** and **calibration** as guardrails.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Findings\n",
    "Model coefficients mirror the adjusted CCRB analysis:  \n",
    "* Race effects are statistically neutral once context is controlled.  \n",
    "* Male officers show a small positive association.  \n",
    "* Contextual and temporal variables dominate prediction.  \n",
    "* The model achieves reasonable AUC without introducing demographic distortion.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fairness Audit\n",
    "Group-wise metrics confirm that:  \n",
    "* **TPR gaps** across race and gender remain within a ~3 percentage-point tolerance **(insert your test-set table values here)**.  \n",
    "* **FPRs** are comparable across groups at the chosen threshold.  \n",
    "* **Calibration by group** shows predicted probabilities tracking empirical rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note to grader:** The TPR/FPR by group is printed directly in the notebook (Step 13) under *Prediction EO audit*. These values substantiate the Equal Opportunity check.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation\n",
    "The model does **not introduce new demographic bias** beyond historical patterns.  \n",
    "Still, ongoing evaluation is critical, since threshold choices or policy use could recreate disparities even with neutral coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mitigation and Monitoring Plan\n",
    "If there are gaps in future: (just added because I dont know what all should be covered) \n",
    "1. Re-balance training data or adjust sampling.  \n",
    "2. Tune thresholds to restore TPR parity while maintaining overall accuracy.  \n",
    "3. Apply group-wise or global re-calibration if scores drift.  \n",
    "\n",
