# Project 1 — Ethical Analysis of Data-Driven Decisions

This folder contains **Project 1**, completed as part of an **ethics-focused data science course**.  
The project combines **data analysis, critical reading of academic literature, and ethical reasoning** to evaluate the implications of data-driven decisions.

This is an **assignment-based project**, not original research, and is included to demonstrate structured reasoning, responsible analysis, and clear communication.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to:
- Analyze a dataset in conjunction with an assigned academic paper
- Critically evaluate the **ethical implications** of data usage, interpretation, and conclusions
- Connect quantitative analysis with **ethical reasoning and societal impact**

The emphasis is not on model performance, but on **thoughtful, responsible interpretation**.

## 🧠 Project Structure & Workflow

1. **Understanding the Ethical Context**
   - Read and analyze the assigned academic paper
   - Identify ethical concerns, assumptions, and limitations

2. **Data Exploration**
   - Load and examine the provided dataset
   - Perform exploratory data analysis to understand patterns and constraints

3. **Analytical Reasoning**
   - Connect observed data behavior with claims or assumptions in the paper
   - Evaluate potential biases, limitations, and risks

4. **Ethical Evaluation**
   - Assess societal, fairness, and interpretability implications
   - Discuss responsible use of data and conclusions

5. **Communication**
   - Present findings clearly through a notebook, report, and HTML output

## 🎯 Purpose of Including This Project

This project is included to demonstrate:
- Ability to integrate **technical analysis with ethical reasoning**
- Comfort working with **datasets, academic literature, and formal reports**
- Clear, structured thinking in non-purely technical problems
- Maturity in evaluating the broader impact of data science work

---

## ⚠️ Notes

- This is a **course assignment**, not a long-term research project
- Multiple formats are included to reflect the full submission process
- The focus is on **judgment, responsibility, and interpretation**, not algorithmic complexity
