# R Coursework — Statistical Computing & Data Analysis

This folder contains my **weekly R programming coursework** completed as part of a graduate-level statistics / data science class.  
The work focuses on building strong foundations in **statistical computing, data manipulation, visualization, and applied analysis using R**.

> 🏆 **Academic Note:** I finished this course as the **top-performing student in the class**.

## 📌 Scope of This Folder

The contents here represent **incremental weekly labs and assignments**, each designed to reinforce a specific concept in R-based data analysis.

This folder is intentionally practice-oriented and reflects:
- Skill progression over time
- Hands-on statistical experimentation
- Repeated use of core R workflows

## 📂 Contents

### 🧪 Weekly Labs & Assignments
Each `.R` file corresponds to a weekly lab or submission and typically includes:
- Data loading and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Statistical summaries
- Visualizations
- Interpretation of results

Example files include:
- `Lab-1.R`
- `Lab 2 submission.R`
- `LAB_3_submission_final.R`
- `lab4.R`
- `Lab 5 submission.R`
- `final_lab_submission.R`

---

## 📊 Datasets

Several datasets were used throughout the coursework.  
Due to data loss and submission constraints, **not all datasets could be retained in this repository**.

However, the code has been preserved in full to demonstrate:
- Analytical approach
- R syntax and logic
- Statistical reasoning

Example datasets used across assignments include:
- Health and obesity-related datasets
- Water quality datasets
- Socioeconomic and global indicators datasets

---

## 🛠 Skills & Concepts Demonstrated

Across the assignments, the following skills are consistently applied:

- Data wrangling with `dplyr`
- Data visualization with `ggplot2`
- Descriptive statistics
- Probability and distributions
- Hypothesis testing
- Correlation and regression analysis
- Working with real-world, messy datasets
- Writing clean and reproducible R code

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Folder

This folder is meant to show:
- My **hands-on proficiency in R**
- Comfort with **statistical thinking**
- Ability to translate raw data into insights
- Consistent performance across a full academic term

It is **not a single polished project**, but rather a transparent view of skill development through structured coursework.

## 📖 Academic Context

This coursework was completed as part of a **graduate-level statistics / data science class**,  
with an emphasis on **practical R usage and statistical reasoning** rather than black-box modeling.

---

## 🔮 Notes & Limitations

- Some datasets are missing due to loss after course completion
- Code is retained to preserve methodology and logic
- Results can be reproduced with equivalent datasets where applicable

---

## ✅ Key Takeaway

This folder demonstrates **strong fundamentals in R and statistics**, backed by consistent performance and top academic standing in the course.
